# Info_School
Data analysis and statistics for School.

## Introduction

In this project, you will have to put your knowledge of SQL into practice.Â 
You will need to create a database with data about School  and write procedures and functions to retrieve information, as well as procedures and triggers to change it.

## Logical view of database model

## Part 1. Creating a database

Write a *part1.sql* script that creates the database and all the tables described above.

Also, add procedures to the script that allow you to import and export data for each table from/to a file with a *.csv* extension. \
The *csv* file separator is specified as a parameter of each procedure.

In each of the tables, enter at least 5 records.
As you progress through the task, you will need new data to test all of your choices.
This new data needs to be added to this script as well.

If *csv* files were used to add data to the tables, they must also be uploaded to the GIT repository.


## Part 2. Changing data

Create a *part2.sql* script, in which write procedures and triggers for adding data, add test queries/calls for each item.

### Part 3. Getting data

Create a *part3.sql* script, in which you should include the procedures and functions for getting data

## Bonus. Part 4. Metadata

For this part of the task, you need to create a separate database, in which to create the tables, functions, procedures, and triggers needed to test the procedures.

Add the creation and filling of this database, as well as the written procedures, to the *part4.sql* file.
